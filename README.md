# THIS IS A SAMPLE REPOSITORY OF SOME CYPRESS TESTS:

## This will run a series of tests against the website: https://www.saucedemo.com/

- Upon cloning the repo be sure to install all package.json dependencies locally: npm install --save-dev
- Open cypress and start running tests from the commandline type: npx cypress open
- If you're on linux you can use ./run_test.sh (you'll need to mode the permissions of the script first)
- Current state of tests: 
  - Presently there are only 2 tests: page access tests and regular user checkout tests
  - In the future more tests will be added to cover corner cases, different user types and more verification 
    of UI elements.
